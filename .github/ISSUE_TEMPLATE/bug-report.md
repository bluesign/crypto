**Critical:** We can't do anything if this isn't actioned immediately (product doesn't function without this, it's blocking us or users, or it resolves a high severity security issue). One person should look at this right now. 

**Important:** * We have to do this before we ship, but it can wait until the next sprint (product or feature won't function without it, but it's not blocking us or users right now). Team should do this in the next sprint.

**Should have:** * It would be better if we do this before we ship, but it's OK if we don't (product functions without this, but it's a better user experience). Consider adding to a future sprint.
